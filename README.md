# Tales Of Shadowland MMO Server 5

This is a multiplayer server based on .NET 8, which automatically generates RPC communication packages and .cpp files for use with Unreal Engine, supporting both C++ and Blueprints. Follow the steps below to set up and start the project.

## Prerequisites

- **Windows 10 or higher**
- **Unreal Engine 5.0 or higher**
- **.NET SDK 8.0 or higher**
- **Visual Studio 2022** 

Before setting up the project, make sure to install the following NuGet packages:

1. **DotNetEnv**  
    [Download DotNetEnv](https://www.nuget.org/packages/DotNetEnv)
2. **Microsoft.VisualStudio.Interop**  
    [Download Microsoft.VisualStudio.Interop](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.VisualStudio.Interop)
3. **System.Reactive**  
    [Download System.Reactive](https://www.nuget.org/packages/System.Reactive)
4. **Newtonsoft.Json**
    [Download Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Newtonsoft.Json)

### Enable unsafe code in Visual Studio

1. Right-click the project > Properties.
2. Go to the Build tab.
3. Check the **Allow unsafe code** option.

## Step 1: Create the Plugin Symbolic Link

Before starting, create a symbolic link pointing to the Unreal plugin directory generated by the server:

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:
.\LinkPlugin.ps1 -ServerDir "G:\Server" -ClientUnrealProjectDir "G:\NetworkSample"
> **If script execution is restricted, temporarily allow it with:**
>
> ```powershell
> Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope Process
> ```

## Step 2: Build the Plugin in Unreal

1. Right-click the `.uproject` file of your Unreal project and select **"Generate Visual Studio project files"**.
2. Open the Unreal project in Visual Studio.
3. When opening, a message will appear asking to build the plugin. Accept to compile.
4. If any error occurs, build manually in Visual Studio by opening the `.sln` file and compiling the project.

## Development Commands

The project uses **pnpm** as the package manager. Here are the available commands:

### 🚀 **Development**
```bash
pnpm dev
```
- Starts the server in development mode with hot-reload
- Automatically restarts on file changes
- Warnings are not treated as errors

### 🔨 **Build Commands**
```bash
# Development build
pnpm build

# Production build (optimized)
pnpm build:release
```
  
## Code Generation

When running the server in debug mode, the system automatically generates the necessary package files and support components for server operation and Unreal integration.

- The Unreal client's Intermediate directory is cleaned.
- The client's Visual Studio project is regenerated.
- Unreal Engine generates the required headers.
- If Visual Studio or Unreal Editor are open, you may need to recompile or refresh the project.
